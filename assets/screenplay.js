Let me have your attention for a moment.
You're talking about what? You're talking about ... 
bitching about that sale you shot ... some son of a bitch don't want to buy land ...
somebody don't want what you're selling ... some broad you're trying to screw, so forth.
Let's talk about something important. Are they all here? 
All but one. I'm going anyway.
Let's talk about something important.
Put that coffee down.
Coffee's for closers only.
You think I'm fucking with you?
I am not fucking with you.
I'm here from downtown. I'm here from Mitch and Murray.
And I'm here on a mission of mercy.
Your name's Levene? Yeah.
You call yourself a salesman, you son of a bitch?
I don't got to listen to this shit.
You certainly don't, 'cause the good news is, you're fired.
The bad news is you've got ... all of you've got ... just one week to regain your jobs, 
starting with tonight ... ... starting with tonight's sit.
Oh, have I got your attention now?
Good ... 'cause we're adding a little something to this month's sales contest.
As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado.
Anybody want to see second prize? Second prize is a set of steak knives.
Third prize is you're fired.
Do you get the picture? Are you laughing now?
You got leads. Mitch and Murray paid good money. Get their names to sell them.
You can't close the leads you're given, you can't close shit, you are shit!
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it, 'cause you are going out!
The leads are weak. 
The leads are weak? The fucking leads are weak? You're weak.
I've been in this business 15 years.
What's your name?
Fuck you ... that's my name! You know why, mister? 
Because you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight, I drove an $80,000 BMW. 
That's my name. And your name is You're wanting.
You can't play in the man's game? You can't close them? 
Then go home and tell your wife your troubles.
Because only one thing counts in this life ... get them to sign on the line which is dotted!
You hear me, you fucking (expletive)? A-B-C.
A ... Always, B ... Be, C ... Closing.
Always Be Closing. Always Be Closing.
A-I-D-A.
Attention, Interest, Decision, Action.
Attention ... Do I have your attention?
Interest ... Are you interested? I know you are, because it's fuck or walk.
You close or you hit the bricks.
Decision ... Have you made your decision for Christ?
And Action. A-I-D-A.
Get out there ... you got the prospects coming in. 
You think they came in to get out of the rain?
A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy.
They're sitting out there waiting to give you their money.
Are you gonna take it? Are you man enough to take it?
Crap.
What's the problem, pal? You ... Moss.
You're such a hero, you're so rich, 
... how come you're here wasting your time with a bunch of bums?
You see this watch? You see this watch? That watch costs more than your car.
I made $970,000 last year. How much you make?
You see, pal ... that's who I am, and you're nothing.
Nice guy? I don't give a shit.
Good father? Fuck you ... go home and play with your kids.
You want to work here ... close!
You think this is abuse? You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?
You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get on a sit?
You don't like it, leave.
I can go out there tonight ... the materials you got ... make myself $15,000.
Tonight ... in two hours! Can you? Can you?
Go and do likewise. A-I-D-A.
Get mad, you son of a bitches. Get mad!
You know what it takes to sell real estate? It takes brass balls to sell real estate.
Go and do likewise, gents.
The money's out there ... you pick it up, it's yours, you don't, I got no sympathy for you.
You want to go out on those sits tonight and close ... close ... it's yours.
Not, you're gonna be shining my shoes.
And you know what you'll be saying. Bunch of losers sitting around in a bar, 
Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman. It's a tough racket.
These are the new leads. These are the Glengarry leads. And to you, they're gold. 
And you don't get them. Why? Because to give them to you is just throwing them away. 
They're for closers.
I'd wish you good luck, but you wouldn't know what to do with it if you got it.
And to answer your question, pal ... Why am I here? 
I came here because Mitch and Murray asked me to.
They asked me for a favor. 
I said, The real favor ... follow my advice and fire your fucking ass, because a loser is a loser.
All train compartments smell vaguely of shit.
It gets so you don't mind it.
That's the worst thing that I can confess.
You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.
When you die you're gonna regret the things you don't do.
You think you're queer? I'm gonna tell you something. We're all queer. 
You think you're a thief? So what?
You get befuddled by a middle-class morality? Get shut of it. Shut it out.
You cheat on your wife, you did it. Live with it. You fuck little girls, so be it.
There's an absolute morality? Maybe. And then what?
If you think there is, go ahead, be that thing. Bad people go to hell? I don't think so.
You think that, act that way. 
A hell exists on earth? Yes. I won't live in it. That's me.
Did you ever take a dump, made you feel like you slept for 12 hours? Or a piss?
Great meals fade in reflection. Everything else gains. Do you know why?
'Cause it's only food. This shit we put in us, keeps us going ... it's only food.
The great fucks you may have had, what do you remember about them?
I don't know. For me, I'm saying what it is, it's probably not the orgasm.
Some broad's forearm on your neck, something her eyes did. There was this sound she made.
Or it's me in the ... I'm telling you ...
I'm in bed the next day, she brought me cafe au lait,
gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.
Eh? What I'm saying, what is our life?
Our life is looking forward or it's looking back.
That's it. That's our life.
Where's the moment?
And what is it we're so afraid of? Loss. What else?
The bank closes, we get sick, my wife died on a plane?
The stock market collapsed? What of these things happen? None of them. 
We worry anyway. Why?
You know, they say, You don't buy it, you rent it. The thing.
You really ... what do you keep? I mean, you don't keep anything, really.
Security. Things. Things. You know? 
It's just ... you try to stave off insecurity. You can't do it.
No. That's what I'm telling you.
Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real estate, what are they?
An opportunity. To what?
To make money? Perhaps. To lose money? Perhaps.
To indulge and to learn about ourselves? Perhaps.
So fucking what? What is it? They're an opportunity.
That's all they are. They're an event.
A guy comes to you, you make a call.
You send in a card, I have these properties I would like for you to see. 
What does this mean? What do you want it to mean?
You see what I'm saying? Things happen to you.
Glad I met you. I'm glad I met you, James.
I want to show you something. It may mean something to you, it may not.
I don't know. I don't know anymore.
What is that? Florida. Glengarry Highlands. Florida.
Bullshit. And maybe that's true. And that's what I said.
But look at this. What is this? This is a piece of land.
Listen to what I'm going to tell you now.
Bruce, Harriett ... we have to admit to ourselves that we see that opportunity
and take it ... and that's it. Now, we just sit there.
I got my pen out. 
Always Be Closing. God, that's what I've been saying ... the old ways.
Convert that motherfucker, sell him, make him sign the check.
They got their money in government bonds ...
I said, Fuck it ... let's go all the way, the whole route.
I take it and plat it out ... eight units, 82 grand, and I say to them,
This is now. This is that thing that you have been dreaming of.
You are going to find the suitcase on the train.
The man walks in the room, that bag is filled with money.
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce ... I don't want to fuck around with you.
No, I don't. I don't want to pussyfoot around.
You think you got to look back on this thing? I do, too.
Now, I'm here to do good for you and me ... the both of us.
What is the point of some interim position?
The only arrangement I will accept is full investment.
And I mean it, that's it ... all eight units. Period.
Now I got the pen in my hand, Rick ... hey.
I turned that contract around ... that's eight units, 82 grand ...
and I said, I want you to sign.
I sat there five minutes.
Then I sat 22 minutes by that kitchen clock on the wall.
Ricky ... not a word, not a motion.
And what am I thinking? Is my arm getting tired?
No. I did it. Just like the old days, like I used to, like I was taught.
I did it. No, what I did ... I locked on 'em.
I locked all on them ... nothing on me ... on them.
And, oh God, I am holding my last thought, Now is the time.
They signed. It was great.
It was so fucking great.
It was like they wilted all at once. Mmm. 
No gesture, nothing ... just together.
Honest to God, they both imperceptibly slumped.
And then he reached and he took the pen and he signed, passed it to her and she signed.
It was solemn ... fucking solemn.
I let it sit, and then I nodded. I said, Harriett, Bruce,
then I pointed into the living room to the sideboard.
I didn't know there was a sideboard in there.
He went over, he brought us back a drink ... little shot glasses with a pretty design in 'em.
And we just toasted in silence.
You stupid fucking cunt.
You, Williamson, I'm talking to you, shithead.
You just cost me $6,000. $6,000, and one Cadillac. That's right.
What are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna do about it, asshole?
You're fucking shit.
Where did you learn your trade, you stupid fucking cunt, you idiot?
Who ever told you that you could work with men?
Oh, I'm gonna have your job, shithead.
I'm going downtown. I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.
I'm going to Lemkin! I don't care whose nephew you are,
who you know, whose dick you're sucking on,
you're going out. I swear to you ...
Anyone in this office lives on his wits ... I'm gonna be with you in a second.
What you're hired for is to help us. Does that seem clear to you?
To help us! Not to fuck us up!
To help men who are going out there to try to earn a living, you (expletive).
You company man.
I'll tell you something else, I hope you ripped the joint off.
I can tell our friend here something, might help him to catch you.
You wanna learn the first rule you'd know if you ever spent a day in your life?
You never open your mouth till you know what the shot is.
You fucking child.
You are a shithead, Williamson.
Can't think on your feet, you ought to keep your mouth closed.
Can you hear me? I'm talking to you.
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office, gotta learn it in the street.
And you sure can't buy it, you gotta live it.
Mmmm. 
Mmmm, yeah!
Precisely. Because your partner depends ...
I'm talking to you, trying to tell you something!
What I told you a long time ago. You don't belong in this business.
You might listen to me. One day you could say, Hey, maybe the guy ... oh, fuck it.
Listen to me now. Your partner depends on you.
The man who is your partner, depends on you.
You go with him and for him or you're shit!
You are shit ... you can't exist alone.
You be as cold as you want. 
You just fucked a good man out of $6,000 and his goddamned bonus because you didn't know the shot.
You can do that and you're not man enough to say it gets you?
I don't know what ... if you can't take something from that, then you're ... scum! 
You're fucking white bread.
A child would know it, he's right.
If you're gonna make something up, be sure that it helps.
Hmm? Or keep your mouth shut.
I'm done with you.
How do you know I made it up?
